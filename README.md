# SegNet and Bayesian SegNet Tutorial

This repository contains all the files for you to complete the 'Getting Started with SegNet' and the 'Bayesian SegNet' tutorials here:
http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/tutorial.html

Please see this link for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started with Live Demo

If you would just like to try out an example model, then you can find the model used in the [SegNet webdemo](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/) in the folder ```Example_Models/```. You will need to download the weights separately using the link in the [SegNet Model Zoo](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/blob/master/Example_Models/segnet_model_zoo.md).

First open ```Scripts/webcam_demo.py``` and edit line 14 to match the path to your installation of SegNet. You will also need a webcam, or alternatively edit line 39 to input a video file instead. To run the demo use the command:

```python Scripts/webcam_demo.py --model Example_Models/segnet_model_driving_webdemo.prototxt --weights /Example_Models/segnet_weights_driving_webdemo.caffemodel --colours /Scripts/camvid12.png```

## Example Models

A number of example models for indoor and outdoor road scene understanding can be found in the [SegNet Model Zoo](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/blob/master/Example_Models/segnet_model_zoo.md).
